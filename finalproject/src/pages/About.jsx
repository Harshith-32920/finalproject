            <p>
                COSC,  an esteemed tech community based in Chaitanya Bharathi
                Institute of Technology - Hyderabad, is dedicated to promoting
                an open-source ethos. We organize a diverse range of events such
                as hackathons, bootcamps, and workshops, aimed at educating
                students about various technologies while actively fostering a
                culture of open source. In these dynamic gatherings, students
                immerse themselves in collaborative coding sessions, innovative
                problem-solving challenges, and hands-on experiences, all
                centered around open source principles. By embracing this
                approach, we empower students to not only learn about
                cutting-edge technologies but also actively contribute to their
                development and dissemination..
